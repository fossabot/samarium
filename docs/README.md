# Components

## Core

### types

For uniformity with using primitives, typedefs are used, for e.g. `i32` for `int` and `f64` for `double`

### concepts

[C++20's concepts](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/constraints) are used to both constrain templates, and overload functions based on types

## Math

### math

Scalar functions and core constants

### Vector2
